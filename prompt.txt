Please create a simple green arow game using Three.js where the player is represented by a blue character(0x009000), and the enemy is red(0x900000). The player should be able to move using the `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` keys to move forward, left, backward, and right. The spacebar will allow the player to fly with vertical speed = 0.15, and holding the left shift key will make the character sit by decreasing the player's height, changing the player's height from 1.5 units (standing) to 0.75 units (sitting). The camera should follow the player’s head and rotate based on mouse movement with a transation to Z axis by 2 units and to Y axis by 1 unit, allowing the player to look around freely. The player should fall with a gravity 0.01 if he isn't pressing the Space key. Add a ground to the scene with the color 0x909000. Make the background of the scene with the sky color.

Add a red circular cursor in the center of the screen to assist with aiming. The player should be able to shoot green arrows(0x009000) by left-clicking the mouse. These arrows should be represented by cylinders and travel at a speed of 0.3 units per frame, with gravity affecting them by pulling them down 0.001 units each frame. Ensure that the arrows rotate according to their speed vector, making them tilt downward as they fall. When an arrow hits either the player or the enemy, the hit character should be teleported to a new random position on the ground.

Please display the number of kills and deaths in a heads-up display (HUD) located at the top left corner of the screen. This HUD should show the current kill and death count, updating as needed.

The enemy should automatically shoot arrows at the player every second. To make the bot’s aiming accurate, calculate the angle needed for the enemy to shoot at the player based on their height difference and the distance between them on the ground. Ensure that the bot accounts for gravity and shoots in such a way that the arrows will land on the player regardless of the distance. You need to calculate the angle given the absolute of the arrow speed and the position of the enemy and the player. It's a complex equation but you need to solve it correctly.
